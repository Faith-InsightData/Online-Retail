## 🛒 Online Retail Sentiment Analysis
Welcome to the Online Retail Sentiment Analysis project! This project provides a machine learning model that predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of retail store reviews. 
This README will guide you through installation, usage, and further customization of the project.

📋 Project Overview
The Online Retail Sentiment Analysis project utilizes a Logistic Regression model and TF-IDF vectorization to predict the sentiment of a review. 
The Streamlit web app provides an interactive interface where users can input a review and receive a prediction.

# Key Features
Sentiment Prediction: Determines if a review is positive or negative.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit.
Data Visualization: Histogram displays for quantitative insights into the dataset.

#🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
Streamlit
Joblib
NLTK
Pandas
Matplotlib
You can install the required packages with the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit joblib nltk pandas matplotlib
NLTK Setup
The stopwords corpus is required for text preprocessing. Run the following commands in Python to download it:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-retail-sentiment-analysis.git
cd online-retail-sentiment-analysis
Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
Open the app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

# 💻 Usage
Enter a Review: In the text area, type the review you want to analyze.
Predict Sentiment: Click the "Predict" button to view if the sentiment is positive or negative.
View Data Visualization: Scroll down to see a histogram of quantities in the dataset.

# 📊 Example
Review	Prediction
"Great product, highly recommend!"	Positive
"Terrible experience, very disappointed."	Negative
📝 Customization
To analyze a different dataset or modify the model:

Replace the dataset file with your own and ensure the column names match.
Retrain the model using your new dataset and update the logistic_regression_model.joblib and tfidf_vectorizer.joblib files.
📈 Visualization
A histogram of the Quantity column in the dataset is displayed as part of the app. You can customize the visualization by modifying the app.py code to display other columns or types of visualizations.

🤝 Contributing
